# Dark Fantasy Life OS — The Oathbound Ledger

A solo dark-fantasy RPG-style life operating system.

This is not a productivity app.
This is a system of **oaths, consequence, and earned rest**.

---

## Core Philosophy

You do not complete “tasks”.
You swear **Oaths**.

You do not earn “points”.
You earn **Marks** — proof that discipline was shown.

You do not “relax”.
You claim **Respite**, and only when it has been earned.

Comfort without discipline is forbidden here.

## Core Concepts

### 🗡 Oaths
Oaths are commitments bound by time.
Failing an oath is not neutral — it is recorded.

- On-time completion earns Marks
- Late completion earns fewer Marks
- Broken oaths remain in the Chronicle

---

### 🔖 Marks
Marks are not currency.
They are **permission**.

Marks are earned only by completing Oaths.
Marks are spent to unlock Indulgences.

No Marks. No excuses.

---

### 🏺 Indulgences
Indulgences are guilt-free rewards:
- Eating out
- Gaming
- Trips
- Entertainment

They are **locked** until Marks are sufficient.
The system does not negotiate.

---

### 🧠 Virtues
Virtues reflect who you are becoming:
- Discipline
- Focus
- Resolve
- Vitality
- Craft
- Social

They rise through action, not intention.

---

### 🏺 Armory
The Armory tracks:
- Consumables (food, toiletries)
- Non-consumables (tools, clothes, equipment)

Neglect is visible.
Shortages are remembered.

---

## The Voices

The system speaks through three rotating voices:

- **The Warden** — cold, exact, unforgiving
- **The Crow** — sarcastic, observant, disappointed
- **The Prophet** — destiny, identity, chosen-one pressure

They do not comfort.
They correct.

---

## Final Rule

> Rest is important.  
> But not all rest is earned.

This system exists to make sure you never lie to yourself again.
